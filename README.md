This directory showcases various scripts I've written in C++1x (assume C++11 unless otherwise indicated)

- STL is a directory for my own (stripped down) implementation of select classes from the STL

- concurrency is a directory for programs that use multithreading

- algorithms is a directory for various algorithms I designed while solving practice problems, loosely organized by topic

- statistics is a directory for programs involving simple stochastic calculations (the sort of stuff you'd see from a data scientist)

- Primer is a directory for random programs I wrote while reading C++ Primer (5th ed.) by Lippman, mostly junk
